# FINRA ingestion into Supabase

The workflow ingests public FINRA snapshots into PostgreSQL, then patches and
validates the rich dashboard from a consistent database snapshot and deploys it
to GitHub Pages. Visitors need no account or database access. The repository HTML
is the UI template; the freshly published artifact is built in `site/`.

## Deploy

1. In the Supabase project SQL Editor, execute
   `supabase/migrations/0001_finra_short_interest.sql`, then
   `supabase/migrations/0002_finra_read_permissions.sql`. Alternatively apply
   both through the linked Supabase CLI migration workflow. The ingestion job
   deliberately does not apply schema changes.
2. In Supabase **Connect**, select **Session pooler**, URI format, port **5432**.
   Insert the database password (URL-encode reserved characters). Use a database
   owner account such as `postgres.<project-ref>`. Store the complete URI in
   GitHub Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions as `SUPABASE_DB_URL`.
   Do not commit it. The script requires TLS. Direct connections also work with
   suitable network access; Supabase direct connections normally require IPv6,
   whereas the session pooler supports IPv4 on GitHub runners.
3. Push and merge the changes onto the default branch and enable GitHub Actions.
   If you have Pages administration access, set Source to **GitHub Actions**.
   The existing branch-based Pages configuration also supports this deployment.
   Manually run **FINRA fetch to Supabase**, with `backfill` checked, to load
   history. Check logs for failures and inspect `public.finra_ingest_runs`.
4. The schedule polls weekdays at **11:17 UTC** (7:17 a.m. EDT / 6:17 a.m. EST). It discovers files by probing
   settlement weekdays, rather than relying on an exact publication time.
   The early run leaves time for ingestion and Pages deployment before 9 a.m.
   Eastern. GitHub scheduling can be delayed; this is not a guaranteed deadline.
   FINRA files released after the morning poll appear on the next successful run.
   Successful periods and their manifest commit together. Recent 45-day periods
   are always reloaded to capture corrections, including removed symbols.
5. For corrections older than 45 days, manually dispatch with both `backfill`
   and `refresh` checked. For outages longer than 45 days, run `backfill` to
   recover missing historical periods. Historical backfill uses the known dates
   in `fetch_short_interest.py`, currently through 2026; extend that list for
   subsequent years. Normal recent discovery continues past 2026 automatically.

Missing-file 403/404 responses are expected during discovery. Other HTTP errors,
invalid files, and failed database loads fail the job, while other periods can
still commit. A 403/404 for a previously loaded period fails rather than silently
claiming success. An access block affecting only unobserved dates can still look
like missing files; monitor the newest settlement against FINRA's calendar.
GitHub schedules can be delayed and run only from the default branch; public
repositories disable scheduled workflows after 60 days without activity, and
forks start with schedules disabled. Check Actions periodically and enable the
workflow again if needed.

## Verify locally

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements-finra.txt
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_finra_supabase.py'
python ingest_finra_supabase.py --dry-run
# With SUPABASE_DB_URL provided privately in the environment:
python ingest_finra_supabase.py --backfill
```

The API roles `anon` and `authenticated` receive SELECT only, with matching
RLS policies; ingestion uses the privileged database connection. Never expose
the database URI or a service-role key in browser code. The dashboard embeds public data produced by the build; the database secret
is never included in the deployment artifact.
Measure database and index size after backfill before assuming the full history
and future datasets fit the project's free-tier allocation.

## Public dashboard publication

After successful ingestion the `build` job runs `publish_finra_dashboard.py`,
validates the resulting HTML, and uploads only `site/` to Pages. The `deploy`
job publishes it to https://zyyzx.github.io/si-dashboard/si_dashboard.html (the
root URL redirects there). On a build/validation failure the previous site stays
published. No generated HTML commits or extra credentials are needed. If legacy branch
publishing is enabled, the workflow also runs after `pages-build-deployment`
finishes on main, so a template build is followed by the database-backed build. The
`github-pages` environment must allow deployments from the default branch.

The build retains the existing curated ticker universe and theme/sector
membership, replacing its FINRA share observations with database history.
The database holds the broader FINRA universe; adding new tracked tickers is a
separate universe/metadata refresh. All three FINRA data blocks share the same
settlement dates. Missing observations remain missing. Screener endpoints require
actual observations, avoiding stale carry-forward. Price runs are remapped by
date. Same-date SI corrections recalculate historical SI% using the previously
published float denominator; new settlement dates have no inferred float ratios.
The page defaults to raw Shares Short and displays separate freshness dates for
float ratios, prices, and Candidates. Market caps and basket membership remain
snapshots. Candidates and borrow analytics still need their separate sources.

Movers compare the latest 1-, 3-, or 13-period SI percent change against prior
changes in the preceding 72 periods (population standard deviation, at least 12
valid prior changes). Missing endpoints and zero denominators produce no signal;
zero variance produces no z-score. Theme heat averages available constituent
13-period z-scores; constituents with z >= 1.5 count as rising. These raw-share
signals are sensitive to stock splits. This methodology is now implemented in
Python; the previous precomputed analytics had no reproducible builder here.

For a local publication build, supply the private DB URL in the environment:
`python publish_finra_dashboard.py --output-dir site`. The publisher verifies
all manifest row counts from the same repeatable-read snapshot before building.
The repository template is not overwritten by scheduled builds. Reload an open
dashboard to see the most recently published version.

## IBKR borrow history (one-time migration)

The borrow collector began on a desktop, writing to SQLite. Its history is the
only copy that exists (IBKR publishes none). See `BORROW_DATA.md` for what the
tables mean and how to query them correctly.

**Before the weekend**

1. **Check storage.** At the real row counts the borrow tables take about
   **510 MB** in Postgres (`ibkr_borrow` 340 MB, `ibkr_borrow_daily` 169 MB),
   measured against Postgres 16. That is before the FINRA tables that already
   share this project. Compare the total with your plan's database allowance
   (Database → Usage) and change plan first if needed.
2. Apply `supabase/migrations/0003_ibkr_borrow.sql` in the SQL editor.
3. Rehearse with no database writes. This takes a snapshot and runs every
   preflight check:
   `python import_borrow_supabase.py --dry-run`

**The import** (on the machine that holds `borrow.db`, from `cmd`)

```bat
schtasks /change /tn "IBKR Borrow Poller" /disable
set "SUPABASE_DB_URL=postgresql://postgres.<project-ref>:<password>@<pooler-host>:5432/postgres"
python import_borrow_supabase.py
schtasks /change /tn "IBKR Borrow Poller" /enable
```

The quotes around the whole `set` argument matter: without them `cmd`
misreads `&` or `^` in a password.

The script snapshots `borrow.db` with SQLite's backup API and imports that
snapshot in **one transaction**. It verifies row counts per table, plus row
counts and fee sums per feed version, plus an exact timezone check, before
committing. Any failure, including the project running out of space, rolls
everything back and leaves Supabase unchanged. It refuses to load into tables
that already hold data unless you pass `--replace`, which empties only the
`ibkr_*` tables.

**Keep the snapshot** (`borrow-data/borrow_premigration_<time>.db`) and copy it
off the machine. Today's nightly backups share a disk with the database, so the
snapshot is the first copy that survives a disk failure.

**Until the collector writes to Supabase itself,** re-enable the desktop poller
(the last command above) so collection continues into SQLite. Re-run the
import with `--replace` whenever you want Supabase refreshed. It is idempotent
and verified each time. At the final cutover: disable the desktop task for
good, run one last `--replace` import, then start the new collector. Two
collectors must never run at once.
